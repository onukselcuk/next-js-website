								<FontAwesomeIcon className={classes.fontAwesomeIcon} icon={faStarOfLife} /> What Are
								Dental Implants?
							</h2>
							<p className="treatment-paragraph">
								The implant can be referred to as the screw-like structure made of titanium. Usually,
								the missing teeth are filled with implants. The treatment begins with engraving of the
								jawbone in the area of the tooth. This is done in a very simple way. A suitable implant
								is selected according to the size of the location and placed in this area. There is
								nothing to be afraid of the placement process. Unless there are extreme conditions, the
								screws will be placed in the jawbone within 10 minutes. Following implant placement and
								healing period, the upper part is mounted with porcelain, E-max, or zirconium crowns.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div className="treatment-general-text-side-div">
							<h2 className="treatment-paragraph-header">
								<FontAwesomeIcon className={classes.fontAwesomeIcon} icon={faStarOfLife} /> Who Is
								Suitable For Implant Treatment?
							</h2>
							<p className="treatment-paragraph">
								The main reason for implant treatment is missing teeth. Bone tissue and structure should
								be suitable for the treatment. If there is a weakness in the bone structure, the bone
								grafting is added to the area, and the structure is strengthened. This is very common.
								In addition, implantation may be inconvenient if there are diseases or conditions such
								as heart disease, diabetes, pregnancy, breastfeeding, hemophilia problems. Patients who
								have health issues should consult their doctors before implant treatment. The patient is
								expected to be able to tend to implant area after the procedure. Apart from these
								exceptions, there is no circumstance to prevent dental implant treatment.

								You can contact us through many channels, the fastest way is{" "}
								<b> Live Chat and WhatsApp </b>, you can also send us a form or an email. Sending an
								X-Ray image is crucial in pinpointing your treatment plan and cost. You can also request
								a video call with a doctor. After the treatment plan is determined, our international
								patients' department will be in contact with you to find the perfect date for your
								treatment. There is no waiting period, we will schedule your appointment to the exact
								date you request or maybe the next day but not further. We value our patient's time.

							</h2>
							<p className="treatment-paragraph">
								On the day of your appointment with our clinic, you will be picked up by one of our
								international patient coordinators right from your hotel. At the clinic, you will be
								greeted by our doctors, and your treatment will start. Our doctor will initially examine
								your teeth physically and take an X-Ray image. For implant patients, our doctors usually
								request an MRI Image to be taken for perfect accuracy in implant locations. After the
								tests, the diameter and length of the implant are selected, local anesthesia will be
								applied, and the implant area will be prepared with dental burr. This process is not
								painful and takes only 5-10 minutes per implant. Later, the implants will be placed, and
								the upper sides of your gum will be stitched. After your treatment, you will be taken
								back to your hotel.

							<h2 className="treatment-paragraph-header">
								<FontAwesomeIcon className={classes.fontAwesomeIcon} icon={faHeart} /> 3) Initial
								Healing
							</h2>
							<p className="treatment-paragraph">
								After the implants are placed, an average period of waiting is about at least 4 or 5
								days. After this period, stitches are removed. You can either stay here in Turkey and
								come back to our clinic for stitch removal, or you can go back home and get the stitches
								removed by a local dentist. But we usually suggest our patients to stay here and come
								back to the clinic for a final check and stitch removal before you leave.

							<h2 className="treatment-paragraph-header">
								<FontAwesomeIcon className={classes.fontAwesomeIcon} icon={faHeartFull} /> 4) Complete
								Recovery
							</h2>
							<p className="treatment-paragraph">
								Depending on your bone structure, age, and number of implants, you need to wait for 2 to
								6 months to achieve complete recovery. This is crucial for the success of the treatment.
								If there are specific conditions, this period may be reduced or increased. This period
								must pass for the implant to bond with the bone to complete the healing process. After
								recovery, you will need to come to our clinic for a second visit. In that visit, the
								crowns are placed on the implants as the last stage of your treatment.
