	introParagraph:
		"The implant can be referred to as the screw-like structure made of titanium. The missing teeth are filled with implants. The treatment begins with engraving of the jawbone in the	area of the tooth. This is done in a very simple way. A suitable implant is selected according to the size of the location and placed in this area. There is nothing to be afraid	of the placement process. Unless there are extreme conditions, the screws will be placed in the jawbone within 10 minutes. This is the basic process for dental implant treatment. Following implant placement, the upper part is also mounted with porcelain, E-max, or zirconium crowns.",
	continuationParagraph:
		"This process applies to situations in which is everything is expected and suitable. Sometimes the structure of the bones in the area where the implant will be placed may not be ideal for the	implant. In this case, a further step is involved. If there is a weakness in the bone structure,we have two options. The bone powder is added to the area, and the structure is strengthened. This is very common. However, if the bone powder cannot be used for any reason, bone transplant from a different area of the patient may be required. In the case of bone transplant, implant treatment may begin after a 2-month healing period.",

			text:
				"The main reason for implant treatment is missing teeth. The treatment can only be applied to people over 18 years old. Bone tissue and structure should be suitable for the treatment. In addition, implantation may be inconvenient if there are diseases or conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, pregnancy, breastfeeding, hemophilia problems. Patients who have health issues should consult their doctors before implant treatment. The patient is expected to be able to tend to implant area after the procedure. This means that in some cases of physical or mental disability, there need to be companions to support the patient. Apart from these exceptions, there is no circumstance to prevent implantation."

			header: "Treatment Duration",
			text:
				"The patient undergoes clinical and radiographic examinations at the beginning of the process. After the tests, the diameter and length of the implant are selected, then the type of prosthesis is decided. The duration of implantation into bone may vary from person to person and the area of the implantation. It is necessary to wait for a while after the first step of dental implant treatment. Because bone structure needs a relatively long time to heal. After the implants are placed, an average period of waiting is about at least 4 or 5 days. After this period, stitches are removed. And the patient needs to wait for at least 2 to 3 months to achieve complete recovery. This is crucial for the success of the treatment. If there are specific conditions, this period may be reduced or increased. In cases where the waiting period is skipped, it may be seen that the fusion is not complete. This period must pass for the fusion of the implant and bone to complete the healing process. After recovery, crowns are placed on the implants in the last stage."

			text:
				"After the implants are placed, especially in the first 2 days, oral care should be given serious importance. Mouth rinse and mouthwash should not be used for a day. The interface brush for the mouth is a cleaning assistant that must be used by patients. The teeth should be cleaned without excessive pressure, and the gaps between the implant and the tooth should be cleaned with the help of an interface brush."
